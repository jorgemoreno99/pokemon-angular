# PokemonAngular

This project has been created by Jorge Moreno Peralta for a technical selection proccess.

This is an Angular application that allows users to explore PokÃ©mon data through a user-friendly interface. The app retrieves PokÃ©mon details from an external API and displays them with filtering and pagination features.

## Observations

Due to the unusual design of the REST API, we have opted to generalize the endpoint used to load images from the HOME component. The alternative option would be very unefficient since it would require making an HTTP call to the specific endpoint for each PokÃ©mon shown in the list in order to retrieve the images. Therefore, this more efficient option was chosen.
